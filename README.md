# Triangle
Displays the following from user input:  Side Length, The Area, Angle Measure, Equilateral, Right Angled, And Point Coordinates
This Program Uses the Point 2D class to Calculate Measures Neccesary to the Program without Point Two you would need to create your own calculations and return it to the Triangle Tester
This Program Safe Guards From Strings (for example: if the user were to input food the program will prompt the user to input a number rather than a string)
Theyre are no exceptions to the string rule so a user cannont input a number within a string of character for example: F1ood. Doing this will enable the defensive guard within the program to prompt the user to enter a number)
